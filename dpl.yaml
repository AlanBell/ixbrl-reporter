  notes:
  - 'note:For the purpose of corporation tax, trading profit is calculated as
    gross profit (£~(gross-profit)) minus a capital allowance for
    AIA (£~(annual-investment-allowance)).  Management costs are calculated
    as total costs (£~(total-costs)) minus depreciation costs
    (£~(depreciation)). This gives a profit before tax of
    £~(ct-profit-before-tax).'
